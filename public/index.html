                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                  I couldnâ€™t decide whether to study engineering, business or design. So I did all three.  I have 3 years of relevant experience and two masters degrees for good measure.

                  <br><br> I am what I'd like to call a full stack UX designer. I deal well with clients and can carry a project from inception up until the last line of code has been written.
                  
                  <br><br>My greatest skill is my ability to keep learning. I've been told I'm a sponge for information. Other than this, I am well versed with dealing with clients, presenting ideas/design, UX research, Prototyping, wireframing, UI Design, and front end development.
                </p>

                  <p>But hey donâ€™t take my word for it. Hereâ€™s what some people who have worked with me have to say about me</p>
                  <p><br><br>"Rithvik, your talent is something out of this world add to that talent the uncomparable will you have, it's a winning mix. You are indeed one of a kind"<h6>Ricardo Mendieta, Co-Founder and CTO at Foo Studio, Member of the Design Jury Panel at Awwwards</h6>

                    <p><br><br>Really enjoyed working with Rithvik. He has good ideas, works hard, takes feedback really well. Would be a great addition to any professional team. <h6>Daniel Savage,Player President at Something Savage</h6> </p>
                    
                    <p><br><br>You were one of the best presenters both verbally, and in terms of putting together an emotional and cohesive story. Your key strengths appear to be your infectious positive attitude, your ability to work well with others, and your desire to get to the bottom of things. These are great advantages to any team or project. <h6>Irene Pereyra, Co-Founder of Anton&Irene.</h6></p>

                <p>I love music! Canâ€™t get enough of it. I play the bass guitar as my main instrument and the electric and acoustic guitar as well for fun. I own a total of 6 guitars so I may have something of a problem when it comes to gear acquisition syndrome ðŸ˜…
                  <br><br>Iâ€™ve also dabbled in writing music. Hereâ€™s a link to something iâ€™ve written and performed. <Insert soundcloud link>

                <p><br><br>I love theatre and spent a lot of time on stage acting in plays and hosting events. I also formed a band that played live music for plays. 
                  <br><br> I also love messing around with after effects and have created some fun motion pieces. I post all my visual experiments on Instagram <Instagram Link> </p>
