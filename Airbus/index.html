          I worked on this project during my time at Pink Lemonade communications. I joined when the project was underway and took it to completion as the lead UX designer. The tool helps users navigate the complex conditions required to obtain a certification of flight readiness. The tool also helps educate users about the various types of certifications.

          On this project I learned how to translate a complicated ask into a simple solution. I also learned how to work with the client in order to refine a product until it meets stakeholder requirements.

      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p>
        The JARUS document certifies flight readiness for drone flights based on a set of factors : 
        1. Preevaluation,
        2. Ground Risk class,
        3. Air Risk Class,
        4. Safety Measures.

        These steps have various sub steps and conditional requirements based on document annexes. My first challenge was understanding the document in itâ€™s entirety including all the annexes. I used the help of SMEs and the stakeholders to make sure I got a complete picture of the document and what was required for the flows.

      <h2>Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        After this I iterated over various implementations keeping in mind that the final flow was meant to be designed in such a way that a user could jump in at any step  based on their skill level. The flow should also account for conditional flows based on the answers the user gave and would need to surface information relevant to the current step.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        The final delivered product had contextual information as an easily accessible information drawer and in addition, it had tooltips at each step to educate users along the way. The tool was designed to be an open wizard with users being able to jump to any step and also jump between steps seamlessly. 
        The final output of the tool was a printable document that could be presented to an airspace operator to get a flight readiness certificate.

          <h1>Process Study</h1>
          <p>
            The application logic had to come from an understanding of the manual process as it then worked. This came in the form of JARUS documents. So I first began to read through them to undertstand how a tool like this could work.

          <h1>SME Interviews </h1>
          <p>
            After understanding the process I spoke with Subject matter experts to clarify any doubts and try and understand the challenges they had. 
            I understood that there were a lot of annexes to the data in the main JARUS document that needed to be considered and that they were highly conditional.

            I spoke with the internal teams at airbus to try and understand what they liked about our current approach (the wireframes developed prior to my joining the project) and what they wanted the final product to be. 
            I understood that there was a requirement for the tool to be both educational and functional.

            With the knowledge I gained from the SMEs and the Stakeholders i began to redesign the wireframes with more of a focus on surfacing the contextual annexed information when it was required as well as making the wizard flow non linear to allow for users of multiple skill levels to use the tool how they wanted to.
